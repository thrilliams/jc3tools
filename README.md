# Just Cause 3 Tools

The original Just Cause 3 modding tools have been instrumental to the growth and success of the modding community, but I'm a freak and a weirdo and I wanted a way to access them without running an EXE or writing more C# code.

Notable changes between these and the original tools include:

-   the ability to export textures as PNG files
-   very few of the tools are implemented

This code was heavily inspired by the code of Gibbed's Tools. (See the [license](LICENSE.md).) Also, this project was very much reliant on Oliver Lenehan's [Bit Bin](https://github.com/sunsetkookaburra/bitbin), so many thanks to him for that.
